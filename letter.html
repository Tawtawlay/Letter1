            You have no idea how happy I am to have met you again and this time to really get to know you. You have been nothing but a wonderful friend to me and I appreciate that. You are a very kind hearted person, and a very fun and energetic friend to be around. Not only does your presence lighten up the room but also my smile. I really enjoyed going on that bike ride with you, even though you kept falling. I just hope you enjoyed it as well. I admire how outgoing and advanturous you are. I guess you a W driver too. Continue being you because you are a gift and a blessing from God.<br><br>

            I’m really sad that you had to leave Lowell so soon. I genuinely mean it. I know that you will do so well in college, and of course I will always be praying for you. I am very proud of you and all your accomplishments. I know it wasn't easy to manage school, sports, music, AND work all together. But you did it, and came out as top 10!! I applaud you for that. I don’t know if you will be back in Lowell for Christmas but just know you are always welcome here. Me and Moses would defintely love to see you again. Until then stay safe. May God continue to bless you and fill your life with good health, happiness, and success.
